{"name":"Ecc","tagline":"","body":"# Elliptical Curve Cryptography\r\nCryptography is a hype and important study field nowadays. In order to explore ECC algorithm, this paper aims to show a implementation of this algorithm that consider a public and a private key combined with a symmetric cryptography to hide messages into cipher-texts. As a result, the cryptography is applied in a TLS communication that is also detailed in this paper. The implementation is also part of a coursework of Advanced Cryptography class that take place in Post-Graduated Program in Computer Science at PUC-RS.\r\n\r\n# Demo\r\nYou can check this working at [http://ecc.storchlab.com](http://ecc.storchlab.com)","google":"UA-51706708-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
